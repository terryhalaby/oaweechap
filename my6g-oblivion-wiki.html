Oi ladies and gents, NoDefiance here, I have made an Unofficial wiki seeing as the previous wiki was not at all helpful and was completely defaced. If you need any information or would like to share any information you have gathered feel free to check it out. All weapon info is currently up-to-date, and I will be adding a lot more behemoth info seeing as the info takes an hour or two to collect. Let me know if there is anything else you would like me to add. https://official-rangers-of-oblivion. "Oblivion" is a song by British band Bastille from their 2013 album Bad Blood.

Skin type Staff Set Hall of Chains weapons Rarity Basic After climbing Maungawhau (Mt Eden) the other day, I realised I had never been up Puketāpapa (Mt Roskill), or Owairaka (Mt Albert), or Te Kopuke (Mt St John). I came home and did a quick Google search and found out there are actually 53 volcanoes in Auckland's volcanic field. During my search I stumbled across this awesome Google Map of all 53 volcanoes (https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0ampll=-36.89166731416869%2C174.82749930078126ampspn=0.322323%2C0.507431ampmid=1H7ZAPJ2xx. For some reason Paranoia (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Paranoia) always resonated with me. When I first played this quest I killed Glarthir after he attacked me once I had said to him (correctly) that there was no reason to be paranoid about the citizens of Skingrad. Afterwards, I wondered had I made the right decision. Should I have just agreed with him and spared his life? Were the citizens actually following him but I just couldn't see it? That quest really showed 
The current list (https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/wiki/index/mods), while showcasing a lot of the classic, essential mods, has become slightly dated. What mods, not currently included, do you think should be added to it? Are there any you'd want to see removed. ''' Anything remotely not supportive of Israel gets downvoted into oblivion on this sub. The JIDF is very real. Google it, since automod banned the link to wiki. Israel pays people to troll on the internet, whether it be Wikipedia, reddit, random comment sections, etc. You can see their telltale marks on every thread about Israel. Why do you think such a tiny country gets so much attention on this sub? If the story is "positive", i.e. Palestinians did something bad, they'll Hello! My playthrough of Bruma is being fun and amazing. Thanks to creators! I finished today the Undeath at underpall quest and Alavva suicided. Before dying, she mentioned an "ancient power" permeating the whole place. Maybe someone more educated than me can tell me what she means. Hey y'all, I'm moving from Oblivion to Fo3 and need to clarify on a some things In Oblivion the leveling is often criticized because leveling tends to actually make you WEAKER and in order to avoid this you have to do "efficient leveling" which is very tedious. Does the same thing exist in fo3? Should I get a leveling mod? Quest rewards in Oblivion were often leveled, meaning that if you complete a quest at a lower level you are given a weaker version of the reward. This encouraged people. So 12 years of playing oblivion a million times over, I made a quicksave by accident and suddenly Uriel got a hell of a lot more interesting before he got smoked. If one saves and reloads before he initiates dialogue to hand over the amulet, there's a chance a whole different string of dialogue with you will ensue filled with some nifty RP flavor. So I ve been reading about the towers who hold mundus in one piece , and I ve seen several being deactivated in several games. The red mountain tower was deactivated with lorkhan heart. The white tower was deactivated with the destruction of amulet of kings. The snow tower in Skyrim is deactivated with aldiun events. I ve hear the redguard got their tower destroyed on their continent after an experiment. So the towers holding the world together are being deactivated one by one  So can Bethes. I'm at my wit's end for modding Oblivion. I've tried OBMM that is apparently known to corrupt .omods created and through experience does not uninstall mods properly and leaves a bunch of files lying around. I've tried TESMM that gives me error messages when I launch and then doesn't repeat them and doesn't do anything about them, and when I try to uninstall TESMM, it leaves a bunch of orphaned files lying around in my Oblivion folder. I've used Wrye Bash to make a bashed patch in Skyrim Since apparently so many people can't see these links at the top of the page I decided to put them here.
